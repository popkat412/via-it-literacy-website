Or, if you've already talked to the the person you want to talk to before, you
can just choose a chat from the main screen. If you don't see the chats, make
sure that you've chosen the "Chats" option in at the bottom.

No matter if you've chatted with someone before, or if you're making a new chat,
you should see a screen like the ones below.

Now that you've chosen who you want to send a message to, you can finally start
typing the message you want to send.

1. Tap the chat box at the bottom of the screen.

2. Type in your message and feel free to add emojis, images, videos, or

3. When tap the arrow icon to send.

4. When you send a message, your friend gets a notification on their phone that
   you've sent them a message.

You can also send voice messages using the icons to the right of the chatbox.
The little square lets you add a sticker. The camera lets you add a photo or
video, and the microphone lets you press and hold to immediately record a voice
message in the app.

But what if you want to send a message to more than one person? You can form a
group chat, where when anyone in the group sends a message to the group,
everyone in the group will receive it.

## Forming a group

Group chats let you share messages, photos, and videos with up to 256 people at
one time. You can also name your group, mute or customize notifications, and
more. A group setting that lets only admins send messages to a group can
streamline communications in specific circumstances.

1. Tap the *New Chats* button at the top right, the same one in the previous
   section

2. Tap *New Group*.

   same way with direct messages to only one person.

You can also easily start a video or voice call in your group for groups of
eight participants or less. Just tap the *Video Camera* icon at the top right of
your group chat to start a video call or the phone symbol to start a voice call.
